# 18. Wildcard week

Goal(s):

Design and produce something with a digital fabrication process (incorporating computer-aided design and manufacturing) not covered in another assignment, documenting the requirements that your assignment meets, and including everything necessary to reproduce it. Possibilities include (but are not limited to) composites, textiles, biotechnology, robotics, folding, and cooking.

## Research into edible cutlery and Mushroom foam

For the Wild Card week, I selected the following two projects to implement as trials.

The photos of the final product is given below
