# 16. Interface and application programming

Goal(s):

individual assignment:
      write an application that interfaces a user with an
         input &/or output device that you made
   group assignment:
      compare as many tool options as possible
      
## Research

From my previous project using ThingSpeak, this time, I used [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/) to get this data onto a mobile screen with a single tap.

Working with the App Inventor interface was quite challenging as it was a new subject, but after several tutorials, I was confident enough to start developing and desiging the basic app operation.

App Inventor is a free, cloud-based service that can be accessed using a web browser. The apps made using the app inventor could be tested on the android phone using the companion app. There are a good amount of learning content available like the ones as beginner-videos, app inventor tutorials, unofficial introduction. Also to use the bluetooth on app inventor, there are numerous resouces available like the one on, App inventor bluetooth.

I created an app by going through the various tutorials, the Design and the blocks screen are shown in the images below.

The Initial testing using Arduino
I first tried programming on a Arduino, and then tried proramming on the attiny44 board created before. I have chosen Arduino for the initial tryouts as there are numerous tutorials and instructions available on the internet. I have went through and tried few of the intructables and tutorials, and finally found this instructable, which I have referenced hugely for the code.

Code used on the Arduino

This week I have learned and explored the basics of Interfaces and programming. I have also successfully did a Android App and connected it to my RGB LED board and via bluetooth.

The files (codes, APKs etc) created this week is available here.
