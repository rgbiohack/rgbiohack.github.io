# 20. Project development

Goal(s):

what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
      what has worked? what hasn't?
      what questions need to be resolved?
      what will happen when?
      what have you learned?

## Outcome

### Tasks Completed?

As far as the project is concerned, the primary goal of achieving freezing using Peltier modules has been achieved without the necessity of a freezer. The freezing of plain water with no added salts and the freezing of salt water with 2% salt have bothe been achieved.

### Tasks Remaining?

The remaining sub-systems for the machine including mold prepapration, automated filling and control of the sus-systems is pending. As thi is a project that is larger than my capapbility to complete alone, I will be partnering with funding partners, automation partners and other stakeholfders in order to bring this as a viable solution to the problem of single-use plastic

### What Has worked?

The following modules have worked without error

project management
computer-aided design
computer-controlled cutting
3D scanning and printing
computer-controlled machining
molding and casting
applications and implications
wildcard week
invention, intellectual property, and income


### What Has not?

The following assignments presented degrees of error that have not been encountered and I am looking to resolve these ASAP

electronics production
electronics design
embedded programming
input devices
output devices
networking and communications
interface and application programming
machine design
mechanical design

### Questions to be resolved?

- Is the process to make the machine worth making open source?
- Is there a viable market for such a product beyond events and public gatherings?
- Will this machine require food safety licenses and will they they be received in time for events?
- Will there be copy-cat machines produced after this project is launched

### Upcoming Tasks?

- There are pending issues in the electroincs development that have yet to be resolved to satisfaction

### Learning

Fortunately, the learning has been the greatest experience of Fab Academy at the moment primarily for the simplest reason of learning about all the open-source tools and community that is distributed around the world in order to achieve similar goals in democratising technology.

The best learning for a first time student of Fab Academy in the First Fab Lab in Bangalore working with multiple constraints both against time and resources ahs awakened a new respect for Fabrication specialist who already work in this area but without the benefitof a community to support their work.

The most important learnings in this coure practice have been the very first principles discussed at the beginning of the course.

- Time Managament
- Documentation
- Completing projects on time
