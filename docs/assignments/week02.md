- Creating my first website with Git.

## Course Website

For making the Course website, I simply used the existing format given as I began learning [Markdown Language](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to write the webpage

Since I was primarily using the Windows 10 OS, I was aiming to use all the software and packages for the Windows system only.

For the Git interface, I used [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), as a stand-alone software for the Windows OS.

Initial cloning of Repository
```
git init
git clone
```

For the Text editor, I used the [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as suggested by the Git Software which allowed me to write in Markdown, save and push using the Git interface alone.

After editing all the code and text in the Markdown Language from the Sublime Text editor, it was a very simple matter to save all the data in the local repository before pushing to the global server.

Adding changes and pushing to GitLab
```
git add -A 
git commit -m "Any message"
git push
```

When making any changes on other systems, I was using the simple Pull command to update all work across all systems

Pulling all changes  when working on more than one system
```
git pull
```
