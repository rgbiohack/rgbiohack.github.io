# 3. The Design Aids of Computers

Goal(s)

- To model (raster, vector, 2D, 3D, render, animate, simulate) a possible final project, and post it on the class page

## Facilities

This week, I took the time to make the model of the final project using Google Sketchup 2017 which we have in the Lab and has the greatest ease of use for a variety of projects.

The first step was to understand the mechanism of action in the Water Bubble Machine and accordingly design the elements virtually before animating and simulating the function.

For that we watch the following video

### Step 1 - Flowchart

As shown in the video, the flowchart of the operations required for the machine are detailed in this image and listed below.

The operations in use will be:

- Mixing
- Mould injection
- Flash Freezing
- Chemical Reaction

### Step 2 - Form Factor

The goal of this machine is to automate the process of creating Water Bubbles and dispensing them in a hassle free process so that they can be consumed by members of the public at multiple locations.

The machine needs to have a simple form factor that allows for:

- Ease of Transport
- Easy to clean and refill
- Simple to customize
- Produce 10 Bubbles per hour

The intial render is depicted here

### Step 3 - Final (tentative) design

The final design is expected to look like this and the following machine processes are foreseen for the creation of this prototype.

Processes expected

- Digital Fabrication and Design for the outer structure
- 3D Printing for the special parts
- Molding and Casting for the mould
- Electronics and Sensor control for the operations and processes
- PCB Design for custom control
- IP and Income from interested parties

## Learning

The varieties of softwares that are required for 2D or 3D modelling are quite varied and related to the completxity of the projects that are to be designed or modelled.

The different 3D softwares that I have used are along with their difficulty are listed below:

- [Solid Works](https://www.solidworks.com/) (+++) - Required basic undertanding of Mechanical Engg. principles and about 40 hours of tutorials
- [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators) (++) - Easier than SW, but still requires extensive tutorials to master
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) (+++) - Made for imagineers and animators
- [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) (+) - As simple as Engineering drawing, but still needs the basic tutorials, also supports parametric design
- [Google Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) 2017 Make (+) - Pro is the best, but free versions with basic plugins almost completely substutues for Pro version, anyone can master
- [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) (+) - Comes with tutorials at every step and a worthy competition for Solidworks without the high price tag

Not coming from a Mechanical engineering background, the ease of use for 3D software was a very important factor in preparing designs and models, and I discovered that the Google Sketchup Software (Pro) easily wins for the amateur designer for its simplicty of use and extensive library that is commonly shared to begin projects.

Among the 2D softwares used:

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (++) - Perfect for learning how to do basic design
- [CorelDraw](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/) (+) - Hands Down the best and most intuitive to use

Modelling Software is incredibly useful to have in specific use cases and my learning will continue until I have basic mastery over all these softwares.
