## Research

To get started with this assignment, I went through the tutorials of [MIT's App Inventor 2](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/index-2.html) and explored all the options for the creation of simple apps for my project.

The goal will be to get the machine to relay data from the sensors directly via tha internet to a Mobile phone inteface from where the progress ofthe operation can be monitored.

Sensors used:

Water Proof Temperature sensor

4 Pin LCD Display

ESP8266 WiFi module for relaying information.
