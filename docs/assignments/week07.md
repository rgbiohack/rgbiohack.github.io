# 7. The Design of Electronic Circuits

Goal(s):

- Group project:
  - Use the test equipment in your lab to observe the operation of a microcontroller circuit board

- Individual project:
  - Redraw the echo hello-world board, add (at least) a button and LED (with current-limiting resistor) check the design rules, make it, and test it
  - For extra credit: simulate its operation

##PCB Design

Being a complete newbie at Electronics design and having only seen and heard about board design, there was a huge learning curve for me, but with the help of in-house members and some advice from the local Gurus, there was a itemized series of steps that had to be followed for the completion of the assignment.

- Designing a circuit board
- Simulating the Circuit operation
- Simulating the board itself
- Preparing the board as per the final simulation
- Testing the board to fit the design rules

##Step 1: Designing a Circuit board

For this exercise, I used an online tool called [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/) which was really simple to use for both schematic and circuit development.

Since Electronics was new to me, I decided to relook at the FabISP Circuit and redesign it for ease of soldering and operation
