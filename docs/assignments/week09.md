# 9. The Programming of Embedded Microcontrollers

Goal(s):

- Individual assignment:
  - Read a microcontroller data sheet
  - Program your board to do something (with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible)

- Group assignment:
  - To compare the performance and development workflows for other architectures

## Individual Assignment

### Data Sheet

The Microcontroller Data sheet selected for this assignment were the ones that have been specified and used so far for the Electronics assignments

[Datasheet 1](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-42721C-AVR-ATtiny417-814-816-817-Datasheet_Complete.pdf "Opens in a new tab") 

The main points to be noted for the ATTiny Class Microcontrollers were:

1. Name and Designation of components ![](../images/week09/1A.png)

2. IC Pinout diagram ![](../images/week09/1B1.png) ![](../images/week09/1B2.png) ![](../images/week09/1B3.png) ![](../images/week09/1B4.png)

3. Block Diagrams ![](../images/week09/1C.png)

4. Memory Maps ![](../images/week09/1D.png)

5. Characteristic Power consumptions ![](../images/week09/1E.png)

6. Voltage References ![](../images/week09/1F.png)

The selected datasheet was quite comprehensive in detail and requires much more time before it can fully be understood, but for the sake of projects selected.

### Board Programming

This was a pretty straight forward task and the steps are detailed below.

## Group Assignment

For the Group assignment, the goal was to compare performance and development workflows for different architectures

From the archive data, there are 5 major Atmel Architectures that are commonly used in the course

- ATtiny44
- ATtiny45
- ATtiny84
- ATtiny85
- ATMega328P
