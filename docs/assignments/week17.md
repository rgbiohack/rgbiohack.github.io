# 17. Machine design

Goal(s):

group assignment
   - actuate and automate your machine
   - document the group project and your individual contribution

## Research

Due to the limitation of mechanical experience for the design assignment, and as covered in the Mechanical design assigment, we decided to build and automate a rotocasting machine.

The build of the rotocasting machine was covered in the Mechanical design assignment and can be accessed [here]. The rotocasting machine was then actuated using a drill machine to find out what would be the force required to digitally rotate the mechanism to get the required output

## Rotocasting Machine Design

The machine design was taken from the following video

The software used was Google Sketchup 2017 and the final result was after designing.

Filling the empty bottle with white paint to allow for clear visualization of the coverage of the paint within the machine.

The time for rotation varies as per the type of material used and the curing time and hardening time for the
