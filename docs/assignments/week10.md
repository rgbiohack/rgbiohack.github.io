# 10. Molding and casting

Goal(s):

- Group assignment:
  - Review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials, then make and compare test casts with each of them.

- Individual assignment:
  - Design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using, mill it (rough cut + (at least) three-axis finish cut), and use it to cast parts

## Materials and Research

For the molding and casting assignment, the following materials were selected for the test casts.

- Hot Glue           - [Data Sheet](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/mediawebserver?mwsId=SSSSSuUn_zu8l00x4x_xNxmvPv70k17zHvu9lxtD7SSSSSS--)
- Silicone Caulking  - [Data Sheet](https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/1799211.pdf)
- Plaster of Paris   - [Data Sheet](https://mypages.valdosta.edu/tauyeno/chemicals/Plaster%20of%20Paris.pdf)
- Paraffin Wax       - [Data Sheet](https://birite.com/wp-content/uploads/msds/2014/690506-nnn.pdf)

Oomoo is actually the recommended silicone rubber, but our stock of Ooomoo had dried up due to a long duration of storage in less-than-ideal conditions. So, in a pinch, I selected Silicone caulk with to get the comparison

## Test Cast

The test cast with all the selected materials are shown below, with a brief summary of the materials

## Final Mold

For the final mold, a 3D milled spoon was selected as there is an ongoing project idea to prepare molds for edible cutlery and plates.

## Interesting Molding option

[This](https://www.instructables.com/id/Mushroom-Packaging/) is a student project that is being done by a college student team that I am guiding remotely. The idea to to make molded packaging from sustainable agro-waste utilizing Mushroom Mycelium as the adhesive. There is a parallel project going on at FabLab Bangalore too.
