# 12. Output devices

Goal(s):

- Individual assignment:
  - Add an output device to a microcontroller board you've designed, and program it to do something

- Group assignment:
  - Measure the power consumption of an output device

## Research

For this assignment, I used an the DIY Arduino to test the output to a 4-pin LCD screen which I will be using in my Final project.

Due to my limitation in being able to assimilate Electronics assignments I have used commercial Arduino Boards initially anfd then progress to simple Arduino boards which were made as per the previous [tutorial](http://www.theparsley.com/arduino/diy/) outlined.
